			<Text>The Kingdom of Italy was a state founded in 1861 when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy. The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which was its legal predecessor state. It existed until 1946 when the Italians opted for a republican constitution.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Italy declared war on Austria in alliance with Prussia in 1866: despite an unsuccessful campaign, it received the region of Veneto following Bismarck's victory. Italian troops entered Rome in 1870, ending more than one thousand years of Papal temporal power. Italy accepted Bismarck's proposal to enter in a Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1882, following strong disagreements with France about the respective colonial expansions. However, even if relations with Berlin became very friendly, the alliance with Vienna remained purely formal, as the Italian lands of Trentino and Trieste were still under Austro-Hungarian rule. So, in 1915, Italy accepted the British invitation to join the Allies in World War I because the western allies promised territorial compensation (at the expense of Austria-Hungary) for participation that were more generous than Vienna's offer in exchange for Italian neutrality. Victory in the war gave Italy a permanent seat in the Council of the League of Nations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Fascist Italy" is the era of National Fascist Party rule from 1922 to 1943 with Benito Mussolini as totalitarian leader. The fascists imposed totalitarian rule and crushed the political and intellectual opposition, while promoting economic modernization, traditional social values, and a rapprochement with the Catholic Church. "The Fascist regime passed through several relatively distinct phases," says Payne (1996). The first phase 1923–25 was nominally a continuation of the parliamentary system, albeit with a "legally organized executive dictatorship." Then came the second phase, "the construction of the Fascist dictatorship proper from 1925 to 1929." The third phase, with less activism, was 1929–34. The fourth phase, 1935–40, was characterized by an aggressive foreign policy, warfare in Ethiopia, which was launched from Italian Somaliland and Eritrea, confrontations with the League of Nations sanctions, growing economic autarchy, and semi-Nazification. The war itself (1940–43) was the fifth phase with its disasters and defeats, while the rump Salo regime under German control was the final stage (1943–45).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Italy was allied with Nazi Germany in World War II until 1943. It switched sides to the Allies after ousting Mussolini and shutting down the Fascist party in areas (south of Rome) controlled by the Allied invaders. The remnant fascist state in northern Italy that continued fighting against the Allies was a puppet state of Nazi Germany, the "Italian Social Republic", still led by Mussolini and his loyalist Fascists. Shortly after the war, civil discontent led to the Italian constitutional referendum, 1946 on whether Italy would remain a monarchy or become a republic. Italians decided to abandon the monarchy and form the Italian Republic, which is the present form of Italy today.</Text>

			<Text>Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini was an Italian politician, journalist, and leader of the National Fascist Party, ruling the country as Prime Minister from 1922 until his ousting in 1943. He ruled constitutionally until 1925, when he dropped all pretense of democracy and set up a legal dictatorship. Known as Il Duce ("the leader"), Mussolini was one of the key figures in the creation of fascism.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Originally a member of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), Mussolini was expelled from the PSI due to his opposition to the party's stance on neutrality in World War I. Mussolini denounced the PSI, and later founded the fascist movement. Following the March on Rome in October 1922 he became the youngest Prime Minister in Italian history until the appointment of Matteo Renzi on February 2014. After destroying all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his fascist followers consolidated their power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years he had established dictatorial authority by both legal and extraordinary means, aspiring to create a totalitarian state. Mussolini remained in power until he was deposed by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1943. A few months later, he became the leader of the Italian Social Republic, a German client regime in northern Italy; he held this post until his death in 1945.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since 1939, Mussolini had sought to delay a major war in Europe until at least 1942. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, starting World War II. On 10 June 1940, Mussolini sided with Germany, though he was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity in 1940 to carry out a long war with France and the United Kingdom. Mussolini believed that after the imminent French surrender, Italy could gain territorial concessions from France and then he could concentrate his forces on a major offensive in Egypt, where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces. However the UK refused to accept German proposals for a peace that would involve accepting Germany's victories in Eastern and Western Europe, plans for a German invasion of the UK did not proceed, and the war continued.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On 24 July 1943, soon after the start of the Allied invasion of Italy, Mussolini was defeated in the vote at the Grand Council of Fascism, and the King had him arrested the following day. On 12 September 1943, Mussolini was rescued from prison in the Gran Sasso raid by German special forces. In late April 1945, with total defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north, only to be quickly captured and summarily executed near Lake Como by Italian partisans. His body was then taken to Milan where it was hung upside down at a service station for public viewing and to provide confirmation of his demise.</Text>

			<Text>The people stand at attention for His Excellency, Benito Mussolini, founder of fascism and harbinger of the glory of the Roman Empire. As leader of the National Fascist Party, you took power as Italy's Prime Minister, and with it sought to design a state conceived in the ideals of a lost inheritance to the ancient Roman Empire and its claim to the Mediterranean. With the conquest of Ethiopia in 1936, you would propel Italy through triumphs across Africa, bringing it glory and power denied by her weak and liberal Kingship. In 1940, Italy would be entered into the Second World War to the aide of the German Chancellor, Adolf Hitler, where you would continue your imperial designs into eastern Europe and Egypt, until your totalitarian government would be finally be deposed by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1943.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Supreme leader, the Italian people do not forget your glorious vision of their future. Italy lays in wait for the dormant legacy of theirs to be rebirthed. Can you seize power and raise from the ashes an empire befitting to glory of Rome past? Can you dominate the lands that were once that of an empire to behold? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?</Text>

			<Text>Il Regno d'Italia fu fondato nel 1861, quando il re Vittorio Emanuele II di Sardegna, in seguito alle guerre risorgimentali, fu proclamato Re d'Italia. Lo stato fu il risultato dell'unificazione nazionale italiana sotto la sovranità del Regno di Sardegna. Cessò di esistere nel 1946, quando si trasformò nella Repubblica Italiana in seguito ad un referendum costituzionale.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nel 1866 l'Italia partecipò al fianco della Prussia alla guerra austro-prussiana, nel tentativo di riconquistare i territori sotto dominazione straniera. Nonostante le sconfitte ottenute sul campo l'Italia ottenne la regione del Veneto in qualità di vincitore formale del conflitto. Successivamente, nel 1882, accettò la proposta di Bismarck di entrare nella Triplice Alleanza, con Germania ed Impero Austro-ungarico a seguito della tensione sorta con la Francia per questioni di possedimenti coloniali. Tuttavia anche se le relazioni con Berlino furono sempre molto amichevoli, il rapporto con Vienna rimase sempre molto freddo per via dell'occupazione austriaca nei territori di Trentino e Trieste. Così nel 1915, quando l'Inghilterra la invitò ad unirsi agli Alleati nel corso della Prima Guerra Mondiale, l'Italia accettò di buon grado perché le furono promesse ricompense territoriali maggiori rispetto a quelle che Vienna avrebbe offerto in cambio della sua neutralità. La vittoria della guerra diede all'Italia un posto permanente nella Società delle Nazioni.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Il Ventennio Fascista è il periodo in cui il Partito Nazionale Fascista dominò il Paese, con Benito Mussolini a capo del governo. I fascisti imposero un regime totalitario e schiacciarono l'opposizione politica ed intellettuale, promuovendo nel contempo la modernizzazione economica, i valori sociali tradizionali ed il riavvicinamento alla Chiesa cattolica. "Il regime fascista ha attraversato diverse fasi relativamente distine", spiega lo storico Stanley Payne nel 1996. "La prima fase, dal '23 al '25, è stata formalmente una continuazione del sistema parlamentare anche se con un «governo dittatoriale giuridicamente riconosciuto». Successivamente è giunta la seconda fase, quella della vera dittatura, dal '25 al '29. La terza fase, con meno attivismo, è andata dal '29 al '34. La quarta fase, 1935-1940, è stata caratterizzata da una politica estera aggressiva, dalla guerra in Etiopia, partita dalla Somalia italiana e dall'Eritrea, dallo scontro con le sanzioni della Società delle Nazioni, dalla crescente autarchia economica e dalla semi-nazificazione. La guerra in sé (1940-1943) è stata la quinta fase, con i suoi disastri e sconfitte, mentre la Repubblica di Salò sotto il controllo tedesco è stata la fase conclusiva".[NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]L'Italia fu alleata della Germania Nazista fino al 1943, durante la Seconda Guerra Mondiale. Successivamente cambiò schieramento passando agli Alleati a seguito della cacciata di Mussolini e della morte del partito fascista. La Repubblica Sociale Italiana, ancora una volta guidata da Mussolini e dai fascisti lealisti, fu lo stato fascista che continuò ad esistere nel nord Italia, continuando a combattere contro gli Alleati, ma altro non era che uno stato fantoccio della Germania nazista. Poco dopo la guerra, il malcontento civile portò al referendum costituzionale italiano con il quale gli italiani decisero di abbandonare la monarchia a favore della repubblica, attuale forma di governo.</Text>

			<Text>Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (Dovia di Predappio, 29 luglio 1883- Giulino di Mezzegra, 28 aprile 1945) fu uomo politico e giornalista italiano, fondatore del fascismo e Primo Ministro con poteri dittatoriali dal 1922 al 1943; Presidente della Repubblica Sociale Italiana dal settembre 1943 all'aprile 1945. Conosciuto con l'appellativo di Duce, fu la figura chiave nella creazione del fascismo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Esponente di spicco del Partito Socialista Italiano, direttore dell'"Avanti!" dal 1912, e convinto anti-interventista negli anni immediatamente precedenti la Prima Guerra Mondiale, Mussolini nel 1914 cambiò radicalmente opinione e si dichiarò a favore dell'intervento in guerra. Espulso dal PSI, fondò un proprio giornale, "Il Popolo d'Italia", su posizioni nazionaliste, vicine alla piccola borghesia. Nel dopoguerra, approfittando dell'instabilità politica e cavalcando lo scontento nazionale per la "vittoria mutilata", fondò il Partito Fascista (1921) e si presentò al Paese con un programma politico nazionalista e autoritario, con forti elementi antisocialisti e antisindacali che gli valsero l'appoggio dei ceti industriali e agrari.Forzando la mano delle istituzioni, con l'aiuto di atti di squadrismo e d'intimidazione politica che culminarono il 28 ottobre del 1922 con la Marcia su Roma, Mussolini ottenne l'incarico di costituire il Governo (novembre del 1922) e dopo il contestato successo alle elezioni politiche del '24, instaurò nel '25 la dittatura, risolvendo con forza la delicata situazione venutasi a creare dopo l'assassinio di Giacomo Matteotti.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Certo di una veloce soluzione del conflitto, entrò nella Seconda Guerra Mondiale al fianco della Germania Nazista.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In seguito alla disfatta italiana e alla messa in minoranza durante il Gran Consiglio del Fascismo del 24 luglio del 1943, fu arrestato per ordine del Re (25 luglio) e successivamente tradotto a Campo Imperatore. Liberato dalle forze speciali tedesche, e ormai in balia delle decisioni di Hitler, instaurò nell'Italia settentrionale, non ancora liberata dagli Alleati, la Repubblica Sociale Italiana. Il 28 aprile del 1945, durante il tentativo di fuga in Svizzera travestito da militare tedesco, fu scoperto e arrestato dai partigiani, che lo giustiziarono insieme alla sua compagna Claretta Petacci. Il suo corpo fu poi esposto al pubblico impiccato a testa in giù perché fosse visibile a tutti e non persistessero dubbi circa la sua morte.</Text>

			<Text>Le genti offrono il saluto romano in ordinato rispetto fascista per Sua Eccellenza Benito Mussolini, fondatore del fascismo e fautore della nuova gloria dell'Impero Romano. Come capo del Partito Nazionale Fascista, hai ottenuto la carica di Primo Ministro e cercato di realizzare uno stato concepito sugli ideali di una perduta eredità di "Roma caput mundi" e del suo impero, reclamando come tua tutta l'area mediterranea. Facendo leva sulla conquista dell'Etiopia nel 1936 volevi spingere l'Italia a trionfi in tutta l'Africa, portando gloria e potere negate dalla debole e liberale guida del re. Nel 1940, guidasti l'Italia nella Seconda Guerra Mondiale al fianco del Cancelliere tedesco Adolf Hitler, per continuare l'espansione secondo le tue mire imperiali in Europa centrale ed Egitto.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Oh, Duce, il popolo italiano non può dimenticare la tua gloriosa visione del suo futuro. L'Italia resta in attesa che la sua eredità dormiente rinasca. Riuscirai a prendere il potere ed a sollevare dalle sue ceneri un impero degno della gloria della Roma passata? Riuscirai infine a dominare le terre che una volta erano parti del più grande degli imperi passati? Sarai in grado di costruire una civiltà in grado di resistere alla prova del tempo?</Text>
